# Business Report – Customer Churn Analysis & Recommendations

## Executive Summary
Customer churn poses a significant risk to revenue and growth. This project applies data science techniques to identify customers at high risk of churn and uncover the key drivers behind customer attrition. The insights generated can be used to design targeted retention strategies.

---

## Business Problem
Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The organization needs a way to:
- Identify customers likely to churn
- Understand why churn occurs
- Take proactive action to retain high-risk customers

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Customer Tenure
Customers with shorter tenure are significantly more likely to churn. Early-stage customer engagement is critical.

### 2. Contract Type
Month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn rates compared to long-term contracts.

### 3. Pricing Impact
Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn probability, particularly when combined with short tenure.

### 4. Payment Behavior
Certain payment methods show slightly higher churn, indicating potential friction in billing or payment experience.

## Model-Driven Insights
The machine learning model assigns a churn probability to each customer, enabling prioritization of retention efforts. Customers with higher predicted churn scores represent the most immediate risk.
