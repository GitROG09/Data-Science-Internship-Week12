# Customer Churn Prediction – Data Science Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data science capstone demonstrating an end-to-end machine learning workflow. The primary objective is to predict customer churn and derive actionable business insights that help reduce customer attrition. Supporting datasets are included to showcase exploratory data analysis and regression modeling skills.

## Datasets Used

### Primary Dataset
**customer_churn.csv**
- Used for the complete end-to-end workflow
- Target variable: `churn`
- Covers data preprocessing, EDA, modeling, evaluation, and deployment preparation

### Supporting Datasets
**sales_data.csv**
- Used for exploratory data analysis only
- Focus on identifying sales trends and business insights

**house_prices.csv**
- Used for regression modeling
- Focus on feature impact and price prediction

> Only the customer churn dataset is used for full deployment.  
> The other datasets demonstrate analytical and modeling versatility.
